    <description>BoxYard, a communal space to enjoy food and drinks located at 4th Ave, gets shut down on one of the busiest days of the year.  On March 17th, 2020 being St, Patricks day, the Tucson Police Department arrived at 4pm to 4th Ave and let business owners know they had to shut down at 8p.m. because governor, Doug Ducey, had announced a state-wide shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic cases rising in Arizona. </description>

    <description>Tony and Susie Stevens, owners of Revolve Cycling, have pivoted their business due to covid-19 pandemic to an outside cycling class. Revolve Cycling is a cycling studio with loud music, fun lights and a welcoming environment. This August 2020, Gov Ducey reopened gyms and bars with safety measures which leads Revolve to bringing their indoor classes back sooner than expected. </description>
